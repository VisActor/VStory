# How to Upload Images

Tutorial documents often require images for better explanation.
We recommend using a stable image hosting service, and here we introduce the cdn.jsdelivr.net hosting solution.

## 6.1 Uploading Images

First, create a folder in your personal GitHub repository to store the images used in your documents.
For example, the directory https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/tree/main/visactor/img contains a large number of images. Taking the image A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif as an example, the corresponding GitHub URL is:
https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/blob/main/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif.

In the specific markdown document, we convert it to a cdn.jsdelivr.net URL:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[username]/[repo name]/[image path]

![Example Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xuanhun/articles/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif)
